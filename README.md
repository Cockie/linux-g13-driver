NOT MY PROJECT  
Just saving this project from the impending Google code closure  

Copied from original page:  
Simple to use and configure UI & Driver for Logitech G13 Gamepad for Ubuntu.

User Interface written in Java. Driver written in C++.

How to use:

Download the project zip file.
Unzip it to what ever directory.
In console type "make" in the directory you unzipped too.
Run the UI config tool first (java -jar Linux-G13-GUI.jar)
Run the Driver (sudo ./Linux-G13-Driver)
Enjoy
